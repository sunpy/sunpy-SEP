## Introduction

The purpose of this SEP is to formally define a mission and vision statement for the SunPy Project.
The purpose of these two statements is to form a foundation upon which the actions of the Project can stand.

The vision statement is intended as a guide to help the project make decisions that align with its philosophy.
A vision statement is meant to be inspirational and idealistic.
It is meant to describe a future that the Project is trying to make a reality.

The mission statement is a formal summary of the goals of the Project.
It describes what the Project is trying to achieve.
It should be consistent with the vision statement.

## Vision Statement

A diverse and inclusive solar physics and heliophysics community that supports scientific discovery and reproducibility through the development of accessible, open-source software.

## Mission Statement

To develop and facilitate a high-quality, easy-to-use, community-led, free and open-source solar data analysis ecosystem based on the scientific Python environment.

## Decision Rationale

Accepted.
