# Introduction
Moves are being made to develop a standardized metadata object for SunPy (and ndcube) data objects.
The benefit of this is that the same type of metadata can be accessed in the same way irrespective
of what data object is being used and what instrument the metadata has come from. To facilitate
this, a set of standardized attribute names must be established for storing and accessing commonly
used metadata in solar physics.  Then a metadata object can implement a translation from the
original file/object containing the metadata file, e.g. FITS header, and the attributes.

The purpose of this SEP is to agree the names of the different metadata attributes. To start with
the list does not have to be exhaustive. We envision that it can be appended to over time. But
once an attribute name is addedit should preferably not be changed so that users can rely on a
stable, backwards compatible API.

For now, this API does not include WCS metadata and should not be linked to a specific file format,
e.g. FITS.


# SunPy Metadata API
Below is a class definition of an Metadata Abstract Base Class (ABC) for solar physics.

# Decision Rationale
This is a great idea because...
