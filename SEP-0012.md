# Introduction

This SEP proposes a redesigned API for the `NDCube` class and it's associated classes in the next major version of the ndcube package.
The primary objective of this SEP is to gather as much community feedback on the proposed API before it is released.
This is also a prelude to a future change, long discussed, to have the `GenericMap` class in sunpy core inherit from `NDCube`.
This SEP should therefore also be considered as a discussion of future changes to the `Map` API, as the API proposed here would eventually (with long deprecation) be adopted by map for the functionality provided here.
That being said, details of the migration of Map to this API are out of scope for this SEP, just a discussion of the eventual API to be adopted.

## Background

The creation of ndcube was originally motivated by the desire to represent and interrogate solar datasets with more than two dimensions, for example two spatial and one spectral (wavelength) dimension.
The fundamental objective of the package's primary class, `NDCube`, is to provide a user interface to this data which would **unite the data with the coordinate information describing the data**.
The benefit of `NDCube` is its ability to do array-like operations which also update the coordinate system.
In addition, `NDCube` works hard to provide information to the user that describes their data based on the coordinate system information.
`NDCube` also provides simple summary visualisation support included in the object.
This uses matplotlib to produce quick, coordinate-aware, and interactive visualisations of the data.
The final major component added in `NDCube` is the concept of "extra coords" which allows the specification and integration with coordinates describing the data not specified by the primary WCS for the cube.

## ndcube 2

ndcube 1.0 was built on the functionality which existed in astropy at the time and provides a very useful foundation for tools such as the sunraster package as well as other efforts to handle multi-dimensional data in Python.
During the process of writing NDCube 1.0 a lot of potential functionality which could be added to astropy to improve the WCS support was identified.
In addition to this in-between the release of ndcube 1.0 and the development of 2.0, various long running projects such as the acceptance and implementation of [APE 14](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE14.rst) were completed.
This means that once many of these brand new features had been implemented in Astropy and gWCS it provided an excellent opportunity to reassess the state of NDCube and to rebase it onto this new WCS functionality.

The main motivation for updating ndcube to use the APE 14 interface was to provide support for gWCS which is being used by the DKIST user tools.
A lot of the other changes presented in this SEP are a consequence of this decision.


## Summary of Changes from ndcube 1

The fundamental change since the original version of ndcube is that the WCS type has been changed to be the High Level API as described by astropy's APE 14.
This opens a lot of possibilities to the future uses of `NDCube` as the APE 14 API allows the mapping between pixel and world coordinates to be described by almost any functional transform.
This could be the commonly used FITS WCS standard, or gWCS or custom implementations for specific facilities with different requirements.

Having made this change, which was a large breaking change from the original API, we reviewed all the existing functionality and API as it was adapted to use the high level WCS interface and the result is presented below.

# Detailed Description

The API presented here is limited to the three core classes `NDCubeABC`, `ExtraCoordsABC` and `GlobalCoordsABC`.
This is primarily an attempt to limit the discussion in this SEP to the core API and not implementation decisions taken in the development of ndcube.
If people are interested in the implementation of the proposed API large amounts of it are implemented on the master branch of the [ndcube repository](https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube) or open pull requests.

The `NDCube` class inherits the astropy [`NDDataBase`](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/master/astropy/nddata/nddata_base.py#L11) class, including inheriting the requirement that the `.wcs` property be a `BaseHighLevelWCS` instance.
In the following code snippets of the API use the Python type hint syntax as appropriate to highlight accepted types and return types, these are not enforced at runtime.


## Overview

Before jumping into the details of the API, this section will provide a *brief* high level summary of the way the following three classes interact.
For a detailed introduction to the whole `ndcube` package please see the [ndcube documentation](https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/ndcube/en/v2.0.0b2/introduction.html), a high level familiarity with the package is assumed in the rest of this SEP.

The `NDCube` object inherits from `astropy.nddata.NDData` and is a container which holds an array, a WCS and extra information about the array like a mask, unit, uncertainty etc.
One of the main bits of functionality that `NDCube` adds on top of `NDData` is some API which allows the user to add "extra" coordinate information to describe the array.
This information is stored in the `ExtraCoords` object which is accessible from the `NDCube.extra_coords` property.
The main use case for these "extra" coords is when an axis of the array has one coordinate described by the primary WCS but that axis also has a secondary coordinate.
A concrete example of this in solar physics is a rastering spectrograph, where one of the spatial axes (the array axis along which the raster is built) also has a time coordinate, this coordinate is not normally included in the WCS.

The second added component, new in 2.0, is the `GlobalCoords` class.
This class, in the same way as `ExtraCoords` holds additional coordinate information, however, the main difference is that `GlobalCoords` are not associated with an axes of the array.
This, almost always, means they are scalars; for example a point in space or a time.
This `gobal_coords` attribute could hold the HPC coordinate of a line spectra, or the time of a map in a way which allows predictable programmatic access to this metadata.
The other thing which is implemented in ndcube, is that when the array is slice such that a dimension is dropped, the coordinate from that axis of the WCS is added automatically to `GlobalCoords`, meaning this metadata is not lost.


### On WCSes

The API specification below includes three distinct WCS like objects (all conforming to the Astropy WCS API).
These are `.wcs`, `.extra_coords` and `.combined_wcs`.
The `.wcs` attribute is the main WCS object for the array; it is required that it have the same number of pixel dimensions as there are array dimensions, the number of world dimensions is arbitrary.
The `.extra_coords` object implements the WCS API but is not required to be a valid WCS for the whole array; the number of pixel dimensions do not have to match the number of array dimensions.
This is because the user can add as many coordinates to the extra coords as is needed, the `ExtraCoords` object then keeps a mapping of the pixel dimensions in it's WCS to the array dimensions in the `NDCube` object.
Finally, there is the `.combined_wcs`, this is a APE 14 WCS object which combines the coordinates in the `.wcs` and the `.extra_coords` properties.

In an ideal world, this API would propose using the `.combined_wcs` property as the default for all the WCS operations supported by the `NDCube` API.
This however, is not currently practical, due to implementation challenges.
While a robust and performant implementation of `.combined_wcs` is something to be desired, blocking the release of ndcube 2.0 on it would be foolish, therefore this API in its current form makes it's use optional.


## NDCube

Below is a class definition for the Abstract Base Class (ABC) for `NDCube`.
Its purpose is to specify the API as completely as possible, including input and return types. 
The behaviour of all the methods should be described by their included docstrings, a version of this (likely out of sync) has been [PRed to ndcube](https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube/pull/304).

```python

class NDCubeABC(astropy.nddata.NDDataBase):

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def __init__(self,
                 data: numpy.typing.ArrayLike,
                 uncertainty: Any = None,
                 mask: numpy.typing.ArrayLike = None,
                 wcs: Union[BaseLowLevelWCS, BaseHighLevelWCS] = None,
                 meta: Mapping = None,
                 unit: Union[str, u.Unit] = None,
                 copy: bool = False):

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def __getitem__(self, item: Union[int, slice, Iterable[Union[slice, int]]]) -> "NDCubeABC":
        """
        Slice the NDCube object by array index.

        An ndcube object must be sliceable in a similar way to a numpy array,
        however, support for a `step` is not required and no "fancy indexing" is allowed.

        A step is prohibited due to the abiguity inherent in applying a step to the WCS
        object; does the step mean a sampling so the coordinate axis becomes discontinuious
        or does it mean that the size of the pixels should be increased by a factor of the step.

        Fancy indexing, or
        `advanced indexing <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.indexing.html#advanced-indexing>`__
        is not supported both due to similar issues with applying it to the WCS, as
        well as it being poorly supported outside of numpy arrays.

        When a slice is applied to a NDCube object it must be applied to the following attributes:

          * data
          * wcs
          * uncertainty
          * mask
          * extra_coords

        the following attributes must be copied unaltered to the returned NDCube:

## Extra Coords

The extra coords property of the `NDCube` class provides a core unique selling point of the package.
It is an easy way to add extra variables which vary with one, or more, of the axes of the data.
The [proposed implementation](https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube/pull/271) of `ExtraCoords` is heavily dependant on [gWCS](https://gwcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), however, the goal for this SEP is to formulate the high level API and not the implementation details.
This will hopefully allow future iteration on the implementation without breaking the functionality of the `NDCube` class.

    """

        slice applied. Supporting step is not required and "fancy indexing" is
        not supported.

## Global Coords

The final part of the `NDCube` API is a class to provide structured metadata for coordinate values which are applicable to the whole cube.
One possible use (not mandated by this SEP) is to have any coordinates dropped by a slicing operation on a higher dimensionality cube be tracked here.
This class is only a slight extension of the API for an immutable dictionary, to enable the tracking of the physical type of the coordinate as well as it's name and value.
The class behaves like a mapping between coordinate name and coordinate object for all read operations.


```python

from collections.abc import Mapping


class GlobalCoordsABC(Mapping):
    """
    A structured representation of coordinate information applicable to a whole NDCube.

    This class acts as a mapping between coordinate name and the coordinate object.
    In addition to this a physical type is stored for each coordinate name.
    A concrete implementation of this class must furfill the `Mapping` ABC,
    including methods such as `__iter__` and `__len__`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ndcube : `.NDCube`, optional
        The parent ndcube for this object. Used to extract global coordinates
        from the wcs and extra coords of the ndcube. If not specified only
        coordinates explicitly added will be shown.
    """
    def __init__(self, ndcube: Optional[NDCubeABC] = None):
        self._ndcube = ndcube

    def add(self,
            name: str,
            physical_type: str,
            coord: Any
            ):
        """
        Add a new coordinate to the collection.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            The name for the coordinate.
        physical_type
            An IOVA UCD1+ physical type description for the coordinate
            (http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/UCDlist.html). If no matching UCD
            type exists, this can instead be ``"custom:xxx"``, where ``xxx`` is an
            arbitrary string. If not known, can be `None`.
        coord
            The object describing the coordinate value, for example a
            `~astropy.units.Quantity` or a `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord`.
        """

    def remove(self, name: str):
        """
        Remove a coordinate from the collection.
        """

    @property
    def physical_types(self):
        """
        A mapping of names to physical types for each coordinate.
        """

    def __getitem__(self, item: str):
        """
        Indexing the object by name should return the coordinate object.
