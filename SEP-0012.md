# Introduction

This SEP proposes a redesigned API for the next major version of the ndcube package.
The primary objective of this SEP is to gather as much community feedback on the proposed API before it is released.
This is also a prelude to a future change, long discussed, to have the `GenericMap` class in sunpy core inherit from `NDCube`.
This SEP should therefore also be considered as a discussion of future changes to the `Map` API, as the API proposed here would eventually (with long deprecation) be adopted by map for the functionality provided here.
That being said, details of the migration of Map to this API are out of scope for this SEP, just a discussion of the eventual API to be adopted.

## Background

The creation of NDCube was originally motivated by the desire to represent and interrogate multi-dimensional solar datasets, such as those collected with the IRIS satellite.
The fundamental objective of the package's primary class, `NDCube`, is to provide a user interface to this data which would **unite the data with the coordinate information describing the data**.
The benefit of `NDCube` is its ability to do array-like operations which also update the coordinate system.
In addition, `NDCube` works hard to provide information to the user that describes their data based on the coordinate system information.
`NDCube` also provides simple summary visualisation support included in the object.
This uses matplotlib to produce quick, coordinate-aware, and interactive visualisations of the data.
The final major component added in `NDCube` is the concept of "extra coords" which allows the specification and integration with coordinates describing the data not specified by the primary WCS for the cube.

## ndcube 2

ndcube 1.0 was built on the functionality which existed in astropy at the time and provides a very useful foundation for tools such as the sunraster package as well as other efforts to handle multi-dimensional data in Python.
During the process of writing NDCube 1.0 a lot of potential functionality which could be added to astropy to improve the WCS support was identified.
In addition to this in-between the release of ndcube 1.0 and the development of 2.0, various long running projects such as the acceptance and implementation of [APE 14](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE14.rst) were completed.
This means that once many of these brand new features had been implemented in Astropy and gWCS it provided an excellent opportunity to reassess the state of NDCube and to rebase it onto this new WCS functionality.

The main motivation for updating ndcube to use the APE 14 interface was to provide support for gWCS which is being used by the DKIST user tools.
A lot of the other changes presented in this SEP are a consequence of this decision.


## Summary of Changes from ndcube 1

The fundamental change since the original version of ndcube is that the WCS type has been changed to be the High Level API as described by astropy's APE 14.
This opens a lot of possibilities to the future uses of `NDCube` as the APE 14 API allows the coordinate system to be described by almost any functional transform.
This could be the most common FITS WCS standard, or gWCS or custom implementations for specific facilites with different requirements.

Having made this change, which was a large breaking change from the original API, we reviewed all the existing functionality and API as it was adapted to use the high level WCS interface and the result is presented below.

# Detailed Description

The API presented here is limited to the two core classes `NDCubeABC` and `ExtraCoordsABC`.
This is primarily an attempt to limit the discussion in this SEP to the core API and not implementation decisions taken in the development of ndcube.
If people are interested in the implementation of the proposed API large amounts of it are implemented on the master branch of the [ndcube repository](https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube) or open pull requests.

The `NDCube` class inherits the astropy [`NDDataBase`](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/master/astropy/nddata/nddata_base.py#L11) class, including the requirement that the `.wcs` property be a `BaseHighLevelWCS` instance.
In the following code snippets of the API use the Python type hint syntax as appropriate to highlight accepted types and return types, these are not enforced at runtime.


## NDCube

Below is a class definition for the Abstract Base Class (ABC) for `NDCube`.
Its purpose is to specify the API as completely as possible, including input and return types. 
The behaviour of all the methods should be described by their included docstrings, a version of this (likely out of sync) has been [PRed to ndcube](https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube/pull/304).

## Extra Coords

The extra coords property of the `NDCube` class provides a core unique selling point of the package.
It is an easy way to add extra variables which vary with one, or more, of the axes of the data.
The [proposed implementation](https://github.com/sunpy/ndcube/pull/271) of `ExtraCoords` is heavily dependant on [gWCS](https://gwcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), however, the goal for this SEP is to formulate the high level API and not the implementation details.
This will hopefully allow future iteration on the implementation without breaking the functionality of the `NDCube` class.

```python

class ExtraCoordsABC(abc.ABC):
    """
    A representation of additional world coordinates associated with pixel axes.

    ExtraCoords can be initialised by either specifying a
    `~astropy.wcs.wcsapi.LowLevelWCS` object and a ``mapping``, or it can be
    built up by specifying one or more lookup tables.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wcs
        The WCS specifying the extra coordinates.
    mapping
       The mapping between the array dimensions and pixel dimensions in the
       extra coords object. This is an iterable of ``(array_dimension, pixel_dimension)`` pairs
       of length equal to the number of pixel dimensions in the extra coords.
