# Abstract
The SunPy data objects (e.g. Map, lightcurve, spectrum) should provide a standard interface
to metadata. A unified interface will provide users a consistent way to access data about 
their data and will enable easy export and saving of the data to standard file formats.

# Detailed Description
The current 

The common core of the meta object features meta tags that are common across all data
objects objects. They provide information about the provenance and time and place that the
data was recorded or simulated. The tags include 

Name | Description | format |
-----| ------------|--------|----------------
time range | the time range of the observation | time range object
units      | units of the data                 | astropy units | 
source | the name of the data provider | string |
source url | the url of the data provider | string |
url | the source url for the data (not necessarily same as source if hosting data)
telescope | the satellite or observation platform | string
instrument | the instrument | string | 
wavelength/energy/frequency range | the spectral range of the observation | spectral range object (does not yet exist) |
level | the level of the data (0,1,1.5,2) | float | 
publisher | the publisher of the data (not necessarily the source) | string |
publisher url | the url to the publisher of the data | string |
publish date | the date the data was published | astropy time | 
resource url | url to more resources about the data | string |
checksum | a hash of the data | int | 
location | where the data was recorded | coordinate object |
view | the view vector | view object
comment | comments associated with the data | string array |
bad data | the value used to denote bad data | float


## Map
Name | Description | format | FITS equivalent 
-----| ------------|--------|----------------
coordinate type | coordinate type of the map | coord object |

## Lightcurve


## Spectrum

This is a great idea because...
