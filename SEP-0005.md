# Abstract
The SunPy data objects (e.g. Map, lightcurve, spectrum) should provide a standard interface
to metadata. A unified interface will provide users a consistent way to access data about 
their data and will enable easy export and saving of the data to standard file formats.

# Detailed Description
The current 

The common core of the meta object features meta tags that are common across all data
objects objects. They provide information about the provenance and time and place that the
data was recorded or simulated. The tags include 

Name | Description | format | FITS equivalent 
-----| ------------|--------|----------------
date-obs | observation time (date and time) | astropy time | date-obs
data-units | units of date | astropy units | 
data-source | the data provider | string | 
telescope | the satellite or observation platform | string | TELESCOP
instrument | the instrument | string | 
wavelength/energy/frequency | | astropy quantity |
