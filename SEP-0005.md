## Introduction
This SEP describes the implementation of a new SunPy submodule
`sunpy.coordinates`. This submodule will provide objects to
represent spatial coordinates in all of the common solar physics
coordinate systems.
This submodule will utilize the Astropy coordinates submodule and
integrate heavily with that module.
This new submodule will replace most of the functionality currently
present in `sunpy.wcs`.

## Detailed Description
Astropy's new coordinates submodule (released as part of Astropy v0.4.0)
provides a well designed and appropriate framework for implementing
solar physics coordinate transformations. The details of this
framework are described below.

The coordinates package is designed to provide transformations
between physical spatial coordinates, it does not provide the pixel
to world coordinate transformation framework. This is handled via
`astropy.wcs`.

### Definitions

The following provide some definitions used in this document with
regards to coordinates. These are based on the definitions in APE5.

1. **Coordinate Representation**: It is a particular way of describing
    a unique point in a vector space (usually 3D space). Some examples of
    significance to SunPy are the Cartesian and Cylindrical representations.

2. **Reference System**: It is a scheme used to orient points in a space.
    It is used to describe how a point is transformed from system to system.
    Examples from the Astropy codebase are the ICRS and equitorial coordinates
    (mean equinox) systems.

3. **Coordinate Frame**: This is a specific realization of a reference system.
    Some systems may have only one meaningful frame while yet others may have
    several different frames. A tentative example in the proposed SunPy
    subpackage would be that of the heliographic coordinates, with
    Stonyhurst and Carrington realizations.


### The astropy.coordinates Sub-Package

The Astropy coordinate submodule has three sets of classes:

1. **Data Representation**: The representation of the coordinate point in 3D
    space. The representation can be  considered as the coordinate vector,
    for example, in Cartesian, Cylindrical or Spherical systems.
    These classes are generally not used by the user, apart from in advanced
    use cases. These representations hold their data in `Quantity` objects or
    subclasses.

2. **Low-Level Frames**: These classes are the objects that describe
    the coordinate system, origin, default representation *etc*.
    They also can hold the coordinate data (in a representation object),
    however, a frame does not have to hold coordinate information and
    can just represent the reference system.

3. **High-Level Object**: The high level object is the
    `astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` object which provides the primary
    interface to both Astropy's coordinates submodule and SunPy's.
    This class can handle a wider variety of input and will sanitize
    this input and create a `CoordinateFrame` class.


### The Proposed sunpy.coordinates Sub-Package

The four primary coordinate systems, i.e., heliographic
(Stonyhurst and Carrington), heliocentric and helioprojective
systems will be implemented. These will take the form of
low-level frame classes - `HelioGraphicStonyhurst`, `HelioGraphicCarrington`,
`HelioCentric` and `HelioProjective`. These will be made to subclass from
`astropy.coordinates.BaseCoordinateFrame`.

To facilitate the convention of both helioprojective and
heliographic coordinate systems of wrapping Longitude at 180&deg; a
custom `SphericalWarp180Representation` object will be created as a
subclass of `astropy.coordinates.SphericalRepresentation` to set the
Longitude wrapping to 180&deg;.

No modification to or subclassing of `SkyCoord` will occur to
maintain maximum possible compatibility and interoperability with
Astropy and other packages which use its coordinates framework.

#### Basic Core API Examples

Creating a helioprojective `SkyCoord` object::


    import astropy.units as u
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    import sunpy.coordinates

    sc1 = SkyCoord(230*u.arcsec, 120*u.arcsec, frame='helioprojective')

Transforming this object to heliographic Stonyhurst:


    sc2 = sc1.transform_to('heliographicstonyhurst')

Creation of an object from astropy Quantity objects:

    Tx = np.random.random([10])*100 * u.arcsec
    Ty = np.random.random([10])*100 * u.arcsec

    sc3 = SkyCoord(Tx, Ty, frame='helioprojective')


#### Helioprojective Coordinate Assumptions

Because the helioprojective coordinate system is a projective
system, where it is unusual to have information on the third spatial
dimension of a coordinate, some assumptions are normally made when
transforming from helioprojective to heliocentric coordinates.

This assumption (as currently implemented in `sunpy.wcs`) is that
during transformation, if no helioprojective radial coordinate was specified
then the radial coordinate is calculated as if the coordinate point
is on the solar surface.

The third coordinate can be specified explicitly upon construction:

    sc = SkyCoord(230*u.arcsec, 120*u.arcsec, 1*u.au, frame='helioprojective')

or will be calculated to facilitate transformations to other frames.

The third coordinate above is distance to the point from the
observer, i.e. radial distance in a spherical coordinate system.
Optionally, the third coordinate can be specified as `zeta = Dsun -
distance`, thus:

    sc = SkyCoord(230*u.arcsec, 120*u.arcsec, zeta=695.5e3*u.km,
                  frame='helioprojective')


#### Observer Location and Frame Attributes

Fundamental to the coordinate transformations in solar physics is
the position of the observer. To pass this information to the
coordinate frame objects, the `FrameAttribute` classes are used.
These classes provide immutable attributes of the frame class, where
default values can be selected and values can be passed into either
the frame constructors or the `SkyCoord`constructor.

All of the frames have all the attributes needed for any frame
transformation defined, this way if all the attribute values are
specified or take their default values all the transformations can
be performed on the data.

The frame attributes are:

* D0: Distance to solar center from the observer [default: 1 AU].
* L0: Heliographic longitude of the observer [default: 0&deg;].
* B0: Heliographic latitude of the observer [default: 0&deg;].
* dateobs: Date and time of the observation [no default].

#### Transformations Between Frames

The transformations between the frame classes are defined on a
bi-directional transformation graph which is specified in
`astropy.coordinates`.
The SunPy frames can register their transformations on this graph
and are therefore detected by `astropy.coordinates` and each solar
coordinate system can be transformed to any other, even if no direct
route between the nodes exists on the graph.

This implementation also allows the possibility of defining a
transformation from a solar frame to an astronomical frame in the
future and therefore allowing the transformation of any solar
coordinate to any astronomical coordinate via the transformation
graph.
