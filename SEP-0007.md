## Introduction

We all knew this day was coming, Lightcurve cannot escape the spotlight any
longer.
Lightcurve moves away from conditional dispatch to a Factory based creation
system so that it behaves like Map.

## Reasoning

This proposal makes an API change, which will move LightCurve to follow the API
of the Map submodule. This will provide end users a consistent interface
submodules and allow for cleaner and easier to read code for developers, much
like the map refactor did for the map submodule.
Also it will separate the interests of the Lightcruve module, into the core
datatype and the data downloaders which belong in the net submodule.

## Relevant PRs

* PR [#729](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/729) The update to the base
factory class, currently used for Map.
* PR [#896](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/896) The work in progress
implementation of this SEP.

## Implementation

### Lightcurve Factory

A factory instance (as proposed in [#729](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/729)) called LightCurve will be available in
the top level of the `sunpy.lightcurve` which will allow creation of all
registered LightCurve subclasses with the following API:

```Python
def LightCurve(*args, source=None, concatenate=True, **kwargs):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------------
    filename: string or File
        A file to read.
    source: string
        A string identifier for a registered subclass, matched by that
         subclasses `_is_source_for` method.
    concatenate :  boolean
        Concatenate all files into one Lightcurve object if True, or return
        one Lightcurve for each file if False.

    All other keywords are passed to _is_source_for and then __init__.
    """
```

This factory will be able to create lightcurves from one or multiple files,
with the multiple file behavior being determined by the `concatenate` flag.

#### Examples

* Create a LightCurve from a file, not-autodetected:

```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve('filename.csv', source='goes')
```

* Create a LightCurve from a file understood by sunpy.io:

```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve('filename.fits')
```

* URLs are handled just like files, they are downloaded to the data dir:

```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve(url)
>>> my_lc = LightCurve(url, url, source='goes', concatenate=True)
```

* Extra keyword arguments are passed to the `_is_source_for` and `__init__`
methods.

```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve('lyrafile.fits', source='lyra', date_events=[x,y,z])
```

* Multiple files can be combined into one LightCurve, as long as they are the
same source:

```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve(['goesfile1.fits', 'goesfile2.fits'], concatenate=True)
```

Which can then be cropped to a timerange:

```Python
>>> my_lc = LightCurve(['myfile1.fits', 'myfile2.fits']).truncate(atimerange)
```

#### LightCurve parsing order

1. Filename:
    1. Expand any iterable objects.
    1. Attempt to read with `sunpy.io`: (Like `Map()`)
        1. Parse metadata to `_is_source_for` and find relevant subclass
        1. Create that LightCurve.
    1. Match â€˜source' flag to subclass and get subclass to read file:
        1. return data, meta pair, create instance.
    1. fail.
1. Other kwargs are processed and passed to subclass class method for returning
 `(data, meta)`.

#### Required class methods

1. Parse specific data files that cannot be read by the `sunpy.io` module,
i.e. CSV or ASCII files. Class Method named `_parse_file` taking a filename and
`**kwargs` which returns a `(data,meta)` pair.
1. Provide a `_is_source_for` which if possible auto detects the data type from
a (data, meta) pair, and also matches string names for the subclass
i.e. 'goes' or 'lyra', which will be passed into the factory to specify type
for download etc.

### Backwards Compatibility

None, due to the current implementation of LightCurve it will be very hard to
maintain backwards compatibility.
It may be possible to implement a `.create()` method that calls the Factory,
however I would not recommend it.
