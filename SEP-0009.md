## Introduction

This SEP defines a release pattern for the SunPy core package and
defines a versioning system. Since SunPy is being used more widely both by
users as well as developers as a dependency, it is important to have clear
and predictable releases.  This is especially important to support other
Python packages which have SunPy as a dependency (e.g. affiliated packages).
A predictable release and support cycle for the SunPy core package will aid
these packages in planning their own development cycle.

The focus of this SEP is not to prescribe how quickly the core package improves
through the introduction of new features or API changes but how and when
release occur and how they are described.

## Detailed Description

### Release Schedule

This SEP prescribes that there will be two planned releases of the SunPy core
package per year with at least 4 months (preferably 6 months) between these
releases. It is suggested that these occur in the months of May and November
based on the current release schedule of the astropy core package. It is the
responsibility of the lead developer to plan a release schedule that is
consistent with these requirement and to present it to the Board at the
beginning of every year, if it differs from this recommendation. Releases are
recommended to be timed to pertinent release cycles of upstream packages. The
lead developer can at their discretion do an out of cycle release if they feel
there is sufficient justification.

### Supporting Releases with bug fixes

This SEP defines two categories of SunPy release, a Long
Term Support (LTS) release and a short-support or non-LTS release. Both types of
releases will be supported by bug fixes and documentation upgrades but for
differing amounts of time. The first release
of the year shall be a LTS release, which shall be supported
for 12 months or until the next LTS release. The second release of the year
will not be an LTS release and will be supported for 6 months or until
the next release. Support periods can be extended beyond the requirements
here if needed.

The objective of this support cycle is to balance the desire to provide a
release cycle for people who wish to experience minimal changes to SunPy while
minimizing the maintenance burden on the SunPy developers. This release schedule
is consistent with the resources available at the time of writing. Should more
(or less) resources become available this topic must be re-evaluated.

### Release Numbering

The following versioning system shall be used.

X.Y.z

Where the three components have the following meanings:

* X. is the LTS version number, this will be incremented with every LTS.
* Y. is the release counter, this will be 0 for LTS releases and increment for each intermediate release.
* z. is the bug fix number, and is to be incremented for any bug fix releases.

An example release sequence, following this scheme, would look like this:

* 1.0.0 is an LTS release, released November 2019.
* 1.0.1 is a bugfix to the LTS release, released December 2019.
* 1.1.0 is a short support release, released May 2020.
* 1.0.2 and 1.1.1 are bugfix releases, released June 2020, to fix a current bug and backport the fix to the LTS version.
* 1.2.0 is an unplanned short support release, released August 2020
* 2.0.0 is an LTS release, released November 2020.

Every numbered release shall be associated with a Digital Object Identifier
(DOI) and it is recommended that major LTS releases be supported by a journal
article if appropriate.

### Deprecations and Documentation

The SunPy core package must always document API changes, in the CHANGELOG and in
the user documentation. Where practical a side-by-side comparison of old and new
functionality will be provided.

In addition to this, where possible, code will emit deprecation warnings
to inform users of planned changes to or removal of API. Warnings will **only be
emitted** when an alternative option exists for the functionality, or the
functionality is to be completely removed.

All effort will be made to provide at least one LTS release where functionality
which is to be changed or removed emits deprecation warnings. This is to ensure
that users who move from LTS release to LTS release still receive a deprecation
warning about changes to the API.

## Decision Rationale

Accepted by a vote of the board on 26-Jun-2019.
