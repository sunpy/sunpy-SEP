# Introduction

This SEP introduces a predictable release pattern for the SunPy core package so
that packages which have SunPy as an upstream dependency can plan their upgrades
and changes in a transparent way. This SEP introduces timed releases and a
versioning system.

SunPy is being used more as an upstream dependency for both affiliated packages
and packages in the wider solar or heliophysics ecosystems. A predictable
release and support cycle for the SunPy core package will aid these packages in
planning their own development cycle.

The desire for stability and predictability is countered by the desire of the
SunPy developers to continue providing new features and functionality and
continue to iterate on the SunPy API to further increase our usability and
correctness.

This SEP therefore tries to focus on when the SunPy core package will be
released rather than placing any strict limitations on changes and API
stability.

# Detailed Description

## Release Schedule

This SEP proposes that the SunPy core package will be released at least twice a year,
initially a release in the months of May and November have been chosen to place
the SunPy release shortly after that of the Astropy core package. The specific
times of the release are at the discretion of the lead developer, and changes to
the months of the releases can be made without modifying this SEP to follow any
pertinent release cycles of upstream packages.

Future changes to the LTS release cycle should be informed by upstream package
development. It is important that upstream packages versions are supported for
the lifetime of a SunPy LTS.

## Supporting Releases with bug fixes

This SEP proposes that there be two categories of SunPy release, a LTS (Long
Term Support) release and a normal or non-LTS release. The LTS release will have
an extended length of bug fixes provided by the SunPy developers. We propose
that the first release in a year be a non-LTS release, which will be supported
for 6 months (until the next release), the second release in a year will be an
LTS release and will be supported for 12 months (until the next LTS release).

The objective of this support cycle is to balance the desire to provide a
release cycle for people who wish to experience minimal changes to SunPy with
minimizing the maintenance burden on the SunPy developers. It is feasible that
we could extend the support cycle of the LTS release to longer than 12 months,
to give users an overlap period where they can upgrade. However, at this time,
supporting more than two releases simultaneously is beyond the
resources of the project.

## Release Numbering

In the numbering of SunPy releases we wish to covey if the release is an LTS
release or not. We therefore propose the following versioning system.

X.Y.z

Where the three components have the following meanings:

* X. is the LTS version number, this will be incremented with every LTS.
* Y. is the release counter, this will be 0 for LTS releases and increment for each intermediate release.
* z. is the bug fix number, and is to be incremented for any bug fix releases.

A typical release sequence, following this scheme, would look like this:

* 1.0.0 is an LTS release, released November 2019.
* 1.0.1 is a bugfix to the LTS release, released December 2019.
* 1.1.0 is a short support release, released May 2020.
* 1.0.2 and 1.1.1 are bugfix releases, released June 2020, to fix a current bug and backport the fix to the LTS version.
* 1.2.0 is an unplanned short support release, released August 2020
* 2.0.0 is an LTS release, released November 2020.
* And so on...

## Deprecations and Documentation

The SunPy core package will always document API changes, in the changelog and in
the user documentation. Where practical a side-by-side comparison of old and new
functionality will be provided.

In addition to this where possible code will emit deprecation warnings to users
to inform them of planned changes to or removal of API. Warnings will **only be
emitted** when an alternative option exists for the functionality, or the
functionality is to be completely removed.

All effort will be made to provide at least one release where functionality
which is to be changed or removed emits deprecation warnings.


# Decision Rationale
This is a great idea because...
