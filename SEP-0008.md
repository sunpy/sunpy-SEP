# Introduction

Code of Conducts (CoC) are being established more and more as a document during
the last years on open source communities and conferences.
The reason to include a code of conduct is not necessarily because there's been
a problem or we expect one to happen.
At the contrary, is just a set of conduct rules that we have always expected
from our peers but it has always been not written down.
Nevertheless, not all OS projects have one or at least not called as such
(*e.g.*,
[community guidlines by scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/community_guidelines.html)).

# Detailed Description

The code of conduct is composed and called as described below, and as referenced
at the bottom is has been adapted from
the [astropy](http://www.astropy.org/about.html)
and [Python Software Fundation](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/):

## SunPy Community Code of Conduct

The SunPy community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse
set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences
that our community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone
in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both
inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a positive,
inclusive, successful, and growing community.

A members of SunPy is,

### Open
Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it is on 
patches, reporting issues, asking for help or otherwise.
We welcome those interested in joining the community, and realise that including
people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our
community.
We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an
environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference,
ensuring that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely
express their opinions.

### Considerate

Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other developer,
users, etc. 
We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in
mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the
community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online,
and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
We recognise the work made by everyone and ensure the proper
acknowledgement/citation of original authors at all times. 
As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited
or acknowledged.

### Respectful

Members of the community are respectful. 
We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments,
and their efforts.
We're respectful of the volunteer and professional efforts within the community.
We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within
them (paying particular attention to those new to the community).
When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
We provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex,
sexual orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual language
and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not
appropriate.
We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as people
within our community.


Overall, we are good to each other and apply this CoC to all community
situations online and offline, including mailing lists, forums, social media,
conferences, meetings, associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.

We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and to not
remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct.
We will take action when members of our community violate this code such as
contacting confidential@sunpy.org (all emails sent to this address will be
treated with the strictest confidence) or talking privately with the person.


Parts of this code of conduct have been adapted from
the [astropy](http://www.astropy.org/about.html) and
the [Python Software Fundation](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/):
