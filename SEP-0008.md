# Introduction

This SEP describes the versioning scheme to use for the SunPy core library.
Affiliated package maintainers can choose to adopt this scheme or develop their
own.

This scheme is derived from 
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and 
[PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/), the main modifications
from the Semantic Versioning specification is the handling of pre and
development releases that follow the specification in PEP 440 to better
integrate with Python packaging tools. This scheme also excludes some components
of PEP 440 and Semantic Versioning, as they are not used for SunPy.


# Version Numbering Specification

## Summary

The version number for SunPy will be of the following format:

    MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[{a|b|rc}N][.devM]

The MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH numbers shall be incremented in the following manner:

1. MAJOR version when incompatible API changes are made.
1. MINOR version when functionality in added in a backwards-compatible manner.
1. PATCH version when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.

The MAJOR, MINOR and PATCH numbers should always be present, the pre release and
dev release numbering are optional.


## Formal Specification

1.  SunPy MUST declare a public API. This API could be declared in the code
    itself or exist strictly in documentation. However it is done, it should be
    precise and comprehensive (*See Below*).

1.  A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are
    non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major
    version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element
    MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 < 1.10.0 < 1.11.0.

1.  Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version
    MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.

1.  Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change
    at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

1.  Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number is
    incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it
    changes.

1.  Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x < 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards
    compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal
    change that fixes incorrect behavior.

1.  Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x < 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards
    compatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It MUST be
    incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated. It MAY
    be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are
    introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes.
    Patch version MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.

1.  Major version X (X.y.z | X < 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards
    incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY include minor
    and patch level changes. Patch and minor version MUST be reset to 0 when
    major version is incremented.
    
1.  A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending 'a', 'b' or 'rc' followed
    by an integer number. The 'a' identifier indicates an alpha release, 'b' a
    beta release and 'rc' a release candidate release. These pre-release
    identifiers are ordered such that a < b < rc, with higher numerical values
    used to determine precedence between versions of the same pre-release type.
    For example 1.0.0b100 < 1.0.0rc1. Pre-release versions have a lower
    precedence than the associated normal version. A pre-release version
    indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended
    compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version.
    Examples: 0.9.0a1, 1.2.3rc1, 2.0.0b10
    
1.  Development release numbers can be used to specify versions taken from
    version control or not publicly released. These versions MUST not be
    uploaded to indexes such as PyPI or anaconda.org. A development release MAY
    be denoted using .devM where M is a non-negative integer number. Development
    releases are ordered by their numerical component, immediately before the
    corresponding release (and before any pre-releases with the same release
    segment), and following any previous release (including any post-releases).
    Development releases MAY also be used in conjunction with pre-release
    numbering.
    Examples: 1.0.0.dev25, 1.2.3a1.dev4532 1.0.0rc2.dev3456

1.  Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when
    ordered. Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version
    into major, minor, patch and pre-release identifiers in that order.
    Precedence is
    determined by the first difference when comparing each of these
    identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor, and patch
    versions are always compared numerically. Example: 1.0.0 &lt; 2.0.0
    &lt; 2.1.0 &lt; 2.1.1. When major, minor, and patch are equal, a
    pre-release version has lower precedence than a normal version. Example:
    1.0.0-alpha &lt; 1.0.0. Precedence for two pre-release versions with the
    same major, minor, and patch version MUST be determined by following the
    precedence rules for pre-release versioning. PEP 440 describes a formal way
    of matching version numbers, which this specification is compatible with.
    

# SunPy Release Schedule

As this document is being written the 0.8.z release of SunPy is the last
non-bugfix release. This section describes the releases to follow 0.8.z and how
the above numbering specification will relate to future releases.

0.8.z introduced a number of major deprecations (e.g. wcs and lightcurve), and
0.9.z is scheduled to be the last release to support Python 2.7. As SunPy has
reached a stage of substantial use and some submodules, such as map and net have
reached a state of relative maturity, this SEP proposes that the release that
follows 0.9.z will be the SunPy 1.0.0 release.

Releasing 1.0.0, and following, the above version specification will define the
public API of SunPy, this API will not be allowed to change without incrementing
the major version number, i.e. 1.0.0 to 2.0.0. The SunPy public API will be
defined as *any object that is present in the `__all__` list in the Python
source*, and is therefore included in the API documentation.

SunPy releases in the 0.y.z cycle have mostly used a "when they are ready"
approach, this SEP proposes that a MINOR release is released every *six months*
with a MAJOR release done on this schedule as required by non-backwards
compatible API changes at the discretion of the lead developer. Under normal
circumstances it would be expected that each MAJOR release cycle would contain
two MINOR releases. Meaning that a MAJOR release would happen every 18 months.
Releases should be targeted for the start of August and the start of February,
although this pattern may slip with time.


# Notes


The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in 
[RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
