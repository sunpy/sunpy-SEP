## Introduction

This SEP proposes that SunPy transitions all internal, and external use of a
Python object to represent a date or time from the standard library `datetime`
module to the classes provided in `astropy.time`. The main classes being
replacing `datetime.date` and `datetime.datetime` with `astropy.Time` and
replacing `datetime.timedelta` with `astropy.time.TimeDelta`.

## Detailed Description

Since its inception the SunPy core library has used `datetime` for handling
time. This is a very useful standard library module, however it lacks some key
benefits that are provided by Astropy and are useful to the solar community:

- Support for non-UTC time scales. This is especially useful for JSOC and HMI data which use the TAI time scale rather than UTC.
- Support for high (double-double) precision time representation and arithmetic.
- Support for leap seconds.
- Support for different representations of time, i.e. Julian Day, unix time, GPS.
- Support for reading and writing the new FITS Time standard.
- Support for light travel time calculations for different locations on Earth.
- Support for custom Time scales and formats, i.e. utime.

The `astropy.time.Time` object can be converted to many different
representations of time, i.e. different pre-defined or custom string formats,
`datetime.datetime` objects. This allows users to convert back to `datetime`
objects if needed.

## #Accepting Time as Input

All over SunPy when time-like objects are accepted as input, this input must be
sanitised with the `sunpy.time.parse_time` function. This function currently
returns a `datetime.datetime` object. The major API change proposed by the
transition to `astropy.time` is the return value of the `parse_time` function
will become `astropy.time.Time`. It is also proposed that the function signature
of `parse_time` be standardised with the signature of `astropy.time.Time` for
clarity, the details of this are left to the implementation.

The `astropy.time.Time` object should be used as an internal representation of
time where ever possible, to ensure consistency of things like leap seconds
which would not work if `datetime` were used internally.

### Other Changes

Many other parts of SunPy will need to be adapted to work with `astropy.time`
and convert to datetime in as few places as possible to maintain the advantages
of the Astropy representation. This will result in the return values of any
functions returning time objects also becoming `astropy.time.Time` objects. It
is not expected that there will be any significant changes in functionality.

### sunpy.timeseries

It should be noted that because `sunpy.timeseries.GenericTimeseries` is using
Pandas it will not be changed to use `astropy.time` it would be necessary to
migrate from Pandas to `astropy.table` to gain the advantages of `astropy.time`.
Timeseries data are currently not sufficiently supported by `astropy.table`.
Timeseries support in Astropy table is proposed to be added in
[APE 9](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/pull/12). It is expected that any
future implementation of timeseries in Astropy will be evaluated and timeseries
potentially adapted to use it. This would be the subject of a separate SEP.

The API of the `sunpy.timeseries` module will be converted to use `astropy.time`
as appropriate although the actual temporal index of the data (which is the
pandas dataframe) will not be changed.

## Decision Rationale

Agreed to in Board meeting of 4-Sept-2018. Implemented in SunPy [PR#2691](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2691).
